# Arduino-ESP8266-4LED-Servo-Project
Simple 4 LED with a Servo Project that Connects to Twitch for User Interaction.

This Project is based on the Slapbot Built by the following:<br>
	Created with code from TheOtherLoneStar (https://www.twitch.tv/theotherlonestar)<br>
	Hackaday IO: https://hackaday.io/otherlonestar<br>
	By Brian Lough (https://www.twitch.tv/brianlough)<br>
	YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCezJOfu7OtqGzd5xrP3q6WA<br>
	Created with code from noycebru www.twitch.tv/noycebru<br>
  
I built it mainly to use a demo for on Stream Project and to work with Twitch Chat commands.

Parts Needed for this Build

1 - ESP8266<br>
1 - Breadboard<br>
1 - Servo (Used is a 180 degree Servo)<br>
4 - 330 ohm Resistors (or 220 ohm)<br>
6 - Black Wires<br>
2 - Red Wires<br>
1 - Yellow Wire<br>
1 - Orange Wire<br>
1 - Blue Led<br>
1 - Red Led<br>
1 - Green Led<br>
1 - Yellow Led<br>

You could use 2 Yellow Wires, 1 for the LED and 2nd for Servo or 2 Orange. Honestly your choice, you could be a monster and use all the same colors.
